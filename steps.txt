**Steps**
1. Loading training data
2. Making data available to PyTorch
3. Designing Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) models
4. Defining the FNN training loop
5. Training and evaluating model's performance with k-fold cross-validation
6. Running the model in inference mode
7. Creating a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve for binary classification
